## REST API Example

Example REST API using only standart library

### TO-DO

- Implementation of 7 endpoints with different HTTP Verbs
  - GET :heavy_check_mark: 
  - POST :heavy_check_mark:
  - PUT 
  - DELETE
- Endpoints needs to do querying
- Providing a scenario for testing purposes

#### Notes
- Because of the need of <id> url pattern, I need to implement regex-like matching pattern for routing.
- How to check what to run for incoming request?
- When looping through arrays using range, it copies the elem so original one stays untouched! 
  - >So the only thing you can do is to either use pointers or the index, as already proposed by jnml and (peterSO)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15945030/change-values-while-iterating].
